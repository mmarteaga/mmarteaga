I'm a Ph.D. Economist with expertise in analyzing economic issues through quantitative methods, with a focus on policy communication and public sentiment. I served as the Graduate Student Council President at Fordham University, developing strategic initiatives and managing a $1 million budget. My experience spans roles at the Central Bank of Chile, REEF Technology, DiMassimo Goldstein, and TIAA, where I honed skills in econometric modeling, predictive analytics, and macroeconomic risk management. As a Salvadoran and former DACA recipient, I bring a unique perspective to my work and am passionate about making data-driven decisions and providing thoughtful leadership
